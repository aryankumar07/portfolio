    What And Why <Span>?</Span> 
</Heading>


Regex stands for Regular Expression which as the name suggest just a regular more generalised formula for identify some expression.\
eg. DateFormat like
```
/\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}/g
```
*Don't worry we will be going through this weird/scray looking expression explaning everything properly*


is a generalised expression (Regex) for date format DD-MM-YYYY . which satisfies all dates like '12-9-2000' or '02-10-2020'

It is mainly used for <Span>Matching</Span> , <Span>Searching</Span> and <Span>Manipulating</Span>

Syntax
</Heading>

lets go through the basics syntax
> All the fancy expression comes between these backslashes '\\\\'\
> At the end of the expression <Span>flags</Span> are specified (we will be going through these flags later)

  Basic Matchers
</Heading>

### Dot(.)
```
/./g
```

this expression means that it will select every <Span>individual Character</Span> which includes the spaces\
In the expression "A dummy expression !"
> <Color>A</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>d</Color> <Color>u</Color> <Color>m</Color> <Color>m</Color> <Color>y</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>e</Color> <Color>x</Color> <Color>p</Color> <Color>r</Color> <Color>e</Color> <Color>s</Color> <Color>s</Color> <Color>i</Color> <Color>o</Color> <Color>n</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>!</Color>


### Character Sets([])
```
/[re]/g
```
This expression means that it will select only the character within the brackets the order here doesnot matter because the characters are selected individually\
<Color>These are Case Sensitive</Color>\
In the expression "A dummy expression !"
> A dummy <Color>a</Color>exp<Color>r</Color> <Color>e</Color>ssion

#### <Span>Usage</Span>

```
/p[re]s/g
```
> this will not match anything because the [] donot actually group the characters but select individual charcter
```
/e[xs]/g
```
> a dummy <Color>ex</Color> pr <Color>es</Color> sion
```
/b[^eo]r/g
```
This regex means that all characters will be accepted except e and o\
'bar baar bor bgr'
> <Color>bar</Color> baar bor <Color>bgr</Color>
```
/[e-o]/g
```
"this is a dummy expression"
This regex means all character between e and o in the english alphabets
> t<Color>h</Color> <Color>i</Color> s <Color>i</Color> s a du<Color>m</Color> <Color>m</Color> y <Color>e</Color>xpr<Color>e</Color> ss<Color>i</Color><Color>o</Color><Color>n</Color>

      Repititions
</Heading>

Previously we had learned how to select individual characters now what if we had to look for multiple characters like 
continues 'o' or 's' for this comes the special character '<Span>+</Span>', '<Span>*</Span>', \'<Span>?</Span>\'

> plus      (+) -> Character can come atleast once\
> asterick  (*) -> Character can come miltiple times or none\
> question  (?) -> Character is Optional (Comes only once or none)

#### <Span>Usage</Span>
```
/be+r/g
```
"ber br beer beeeer"
> <Color>ber</Color> br <Color>beer</Color> <Color>beeeer</Color>

```
/be*r/g
```
> <Color>ber</Color> <Color>br</Color> <Color>beer</Color> <Color>beeeer</Color>
```
/colou?r/g
```
"color colour colouur"
> <Color>color</Color> <Color>colour</Color> colouur

#### Suppose if you want to have a character repitition a specific number of times then specify the number inside the {}
```
/opo{2}se/g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose"\
\{n\} means that the character can come only n times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse opooose 

```
/opo{2,}se/g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose"\
\{n,\} means that the character can come atleast n times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse <Color>opooose</Color> 

```
/opo{2,4}se/g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose opoooose opooooose"\
\{n,m\} means that the character can come atleast n and at mac m times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse <Color>opooose</Color>  <Color>opoooose</Color> opooooose 


#### Some more Character class
- \w -> selects a single english alphabets
- \W -> Not a word
- \d -> selects only digits
- \D -> selects that are not digits
- \s -> selects a whitespace
- \S -> selects a not whitespace
- \b -> tells about the start and end of a word

Grouping
</Heading>

Cool till now we have learned how to select character multiple times though take care that till now you could at max select same
character so what if you want to select multiple different character well look no further you can do using parantheis -> ()

for example you want to find a group of repititing "ha" in 
> haha h ha hahahaa
```
 /(ha)+/g
```
> <Color>haha</Color> h <Color>ha</Color> <Color>hahaha</Color> a

Another great feature that grouping does is that an automatic reference is set to the groups so that the reference can be called whenever we want

for example we want to select a group of words that repeats in a continiuity

> hello hello world world world there
```
/(\w+)\s+\1/g
```
> <Color>hello hello</Color> <Color>world world</Color> world there

<Explain>
(\w+) -> this select the word as a whole (there will be atleast one word)

\s -> this looks for a backspace (atleast one)

\1 -> this reference the first group  that was made which reference to (\w+)

also note that the last two world could also be selected This happens because regex engines consume characters after a match, 
so after matching the first world world, the remaining string is " world there", and "world there" doesnâ€™t match (\w+)\s+\1.
</Explain>

<Span>Usage</Span>

lets take a tricky example lets looks for palindromes 

> abba level radar test

```
/\b(\w)(\w)\2\1\b/g
```
> <Color>abba</Color> level radar test

<Explain>
\b -> means that the word should be started with a letter instead starting in between words

(\w) -> select a single character gets a reference 1

(\w) -> select a single character but this time gets a reference of 2

\2 -> repeat the second reference

\1 -> repeat the first reference

\b -> the word ends here


Note :- level and radar are also palindromes but not selected
</Explain>

#### Non-capturing Groups


Now suppose if you donot want to include the group into a reference then regex provides a method for that too they are called
Non-capturing groups and this is the synatx for it
```
(?:<regex>)
```
supoose we want to look for a number
> 123-234-3456
```
/(?:\d{3}-){2}-\d{4}/g
```
> <Color>123-234-3456</Color>

Note :- we didnot use a capturing group because if we used then the same group that was captured had to written again

LookArounds
</Heading>

Lookarounds are zero-width assertions that check if a pattern exists ahead (lookahead) or behind (lookbehind) the current 
position without consuming characters. They allow you to enforce conditions without including them in the match.

there are 4 types of LookArounds
- `(?=....)` - positive lookahead
- `(?!....)` - negative lookahead
- `(?<=....)` - positive lookbehind
- `(?<!....)` - negative lookbehind

<Span>Usage</Span>

#### Positive LookAhead
> 1st 2nd 3pc
```
/\d(?=nd)/g
```
> 1st <Color>2</Color> nd 3pc

#### Negative LookAhead
> 1st 2nd 3pc
```
/\d(?!nd)/g
```
> <Color>1</Color> st 2nd <Color>3</Color> pc

#### Positive LookBehind
> #1 $2 %3
```
/(?<=%)\d/g
```
> #1 $2 % <Color>3</Color>

#### Negative LookBehind
> #1 $2 %3
```
/(?<!%)\d/g
```
> \# <Color>1</Color> $ <Color>2</Color> %3

Flags
</Heading>

The basics are covered till now lets learn about the flags this time

- i -> as regex is case sensitive by specifying the i flag it becames case-insensitive
- g -> this ensure that the regex engine does not stop at the first occurence
- m -> If not enabled, line start and end equals the beginning and end of the entire string. It doesn't work for each row individually.

Note :- this Flags can be appended on to each other
