    What And Why <Span>?</Span> 
</Heading>


Regex stands for Regular Expression which as the name suggest just a regular more generalised formula for identify some expression.\
eg. DateFormat like
```
\/d{2}-/d{2}-/d{4}\g
```
*Don't worry we will be going through this weird/scray looking expression explaning everything properly*


is a generalised expression (Regex) for date format DD-MM-YYYY . which satisfies all dates like '12-9-2000' or '02-10-2020'

It is mainly used for <Span>Matching</Span> , <Span>Searching</Span> and <Span>Manipulating</Span>

Syntax

lets go through the basics syntax
> All the fancy expression comes between these backslashes '\\\\'\
> At the end of the expression <Span>flags</Span> are specified (we will be going through these flags later)

  Basic Matchers
</Heading>

### Dot(.)
```
\.\g
```

this expression means that it will select every <Span>individual Character</Span> which includes the spaces\
In the expression "A dummy expression !"
> <Color>A</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>d</Color> <Color>u</Color> <Color>m</Color> <Color>m</Color> <Color>y</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>e</Color> <Color>x</Color> <Color>p</Color> <Color>r</Color> <Color>e</Color> <Color>s</Color> <Color>s</Color> <Color>i</Color> <Color>o</Color> <Color>n</Color> <Color>.</Color> <Color>!</Color>


### Character Sets([])
```
\[re]\g
```
This expression means that it will select only the character within the brackets the order here doesnot matter because the characters are selected individually\
<Color>These are Case Sensitive</Color>\
In the expression "A dummy expression !"
> A dummy <Color>a</Color>exp<Color>r</Color> <Color>e</Color>ssion

#### <Span>Usage</Span>

```
\p[re]s\g
```
> this will not match anything because the [] donot actually group the characters but select individual charcter
```
\e[xs]\g
```
> a dummy <Color>ex</Color> pr <Color>es</Color> sion
```
\b[^eo]r\g
```
This regex means that all characters will be accepted except e and o\
'bar baar bor bgr'
> <Color>bar</Color> baar bor <Color>bgr</Color>
```
\[e-o]\g
```
"this is a dummy expression"
This regex means all character between e and o in the english alphabets
> t<Color>h</Color> <Color>i</Color> s <Color>i</Color> s a du<Color>m</Color> <Color>m</Color> y <Color>e</Color>xpr<Color>e</Color> ss<Color>i</Color><Color>o</Color><Color>n</Color>


<Heading id="blogHeads3" type='primary'>
      Repititions
</Heading>

Previously we had learned how to select individual characters now what if we had to look for multiple characters like 
continues 'o' or 's' for this comes the special character '<Span>+</Span>', '<Span>*</Span>', \'<Span>?</Span>\'

> plus      (+) -> Character can come atleast once\
> asterick  (*) -> Character can come miltiple times or none\
> question  (?) -> Character is Optional (Comes only once or none)

#### <Span>Usage</Span>
```
\be+r\g
```
"ber br beer beeeer"
> <Color>ber</Color> br <Color>beer</Color> <Color>beeeer</Color>

```
\be*r\g
```
> <Color>ber</Color> <Color>br</Color> <Color>beer</Color> <Color>beeeer</Color>
```
\colou?r\g
```
"color colour colouur"
> <Color>color</Color> <Color>colour</Color> colouur

#### Suppose if you want to have a character repitition a specific number of times then specify the number inside the {}
```
\opo{2}se\g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose"\
\{n\} means that the character can come only n times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse opooose 

```
\opo{2,}se\g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose"\
\{n,\} means that the character can come atleast n times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse <Color>opooose</Color> 

```
\opo{2,4}se\g
```
"opose opoose opse opooose opoooose opooooose"\
\{n,m\} means that the character can come atleast n and at mac m times
> opose <Color>opoose</Color> opse <Color>opooose</Color>  <Color>opoooose</Color> opooooose
